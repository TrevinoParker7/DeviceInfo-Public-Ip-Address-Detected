# Use Case
**Detection of Internet-facing sensitive assets**

## Example Scenario:
During routine maintenance, the security team is tasked with investigating any VMs in the shared services cluster (handling DNS, Domain Services, DHCP, etc.) that have mistakenly been exposed to the public internet. The goal is to identify any misconfigured VMs and check for potential brute-force login attempts/successes from external sources. Internal shared services device (e.g., a domain controller) is mistakenly exposed to the internet due to misconfiguration.

### **Timeline Overview**  
1. **üîç Archiving Activity:**  
   - **Observed Behavior:**  Windows-target-1 has been internet facing for several day.Last Internet facing time 2025-01-06T19:15:05.9710276Z."
  
   - **Detection Query 
```kql
DeviceInfo
//| where DeviceName == "ms-edr" // Optional for specific device(s)
| where isnull(IsInternetFacing) or IsInternetFacing == false
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, OSPlatform, PublicIP, IsInternetFacing
| order by Timestamp desc
```

**üìù Response:**  
   - Shared findings with the manager, the device was isolated, awaiting further instructions.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Provision a virtual machine with a public IP address
2. Ensure the device is actively communicating or available on the internet. (Test ping, etc.)
3. Onboard the device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
4. Verify the relevant logs (e.g., network traffic logs, exposure alerts) are being collected in MDE.
5. Execute the KQL query in the MDE advanced hunting to confirm detection.
